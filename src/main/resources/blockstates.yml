# 1.0
# BlockState Mappings File.
#
# BlockState mappings can easily be added so long as you follow the specification:
#
# mappings:
#   mod_id: -> Consult the mod/plugin author for this
#     block_id -> Wiki/Mod Author/Block.java in official source is your friend
#       some_readable_name: -> This is the name you'll use in populators.yml, can be whatever you want
#         some_property_name: -> some_property_value
#         ... continue for how many properties that may exist
#
general:
    # Specifiying true here prints out mappings. Very spammy, only use this to verify your stuff is being registered.
