# 1.0
# Populator Mappings File.
#
# Populator mappings can easily be added so long as you follow the specification:
#
# populators:
#   mod_id: -> Consult the mod/plugin author for this
#       populator_id: ->
#           mapped_populator_block: mapped_replacement_block -> Instructs the populator to take the populator block
#                                                               and replace it with the replacement block. An example
#                                                               would be taking stone and replacing with water.
#
# Another feature is an "all" replacement. This means, literally, replace all found instances of a blockstate with
# with another blockstate.
#
# all:
#   mapped_populator_block: mapped_replacement_block
#
general:
    # Specifiying true here prints out mappings. Very spammy, only use this to verify your stuff is being registered.
