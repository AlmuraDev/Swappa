### Prerequisites
* [Java] 8
* [Gradle] 2.7+

### Usage
See the generated `blockstates.yml` and `populators.yml` in `~/config/swappa` for configuration.

To print out all blockstates to `~/config/swappa/dump.yml` run `/dump`. This requires the permission node `swappa.command.dump`.

### Building
**Note:** If you do not have [Gradle] installed then use `./gradlew` for Unix systems or Git Bash and `gradlew.bat` for Windows systems in place of any `gradle` command.

To build Swappa, simply run `gradle`. The compiled jar is located in `./libs/`.
